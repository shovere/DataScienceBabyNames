select * 
from (select year, sum(names.num)
     from names
     group by names.year) as a left join (select * 
                                         from names 
                                         where names.name = "lia") b on a.year = b.year


or we can do 


select DISTINCT(names.year)
from names

//this gets total number per year as well
select *
from (select year, sum(names.num) as total
     from names
     group by names.year) as a, names
where names.year = a.year and names.name = "Lia"
order by a.year



//this only gets num year pair
select year, num 
from names
where names.name = "Lia"
order by year

//prob the best one
select a.year, IFNULL(b.num, 0) as num
from (select DISTINCT(names.year)
     from names ) as a left join (select * 
                                         from names 
                                         where names.name = "Lia") b on a.year = b.year
